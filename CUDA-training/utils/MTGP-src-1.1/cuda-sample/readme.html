    <h2>MTGP CUDA SAMPLE</h2>
    <h2>READ ME FIRST</h2>

    <p>
      This directory contains some sample programs of MTGP
      for CUDA. Files in this directory are just samples,
      feel free to copy and change.
    </p>
    <p>
      I checked these sample files under the environment of CUDA 4.0,
      But this does not mean these samples use new features of CUDA 4.0.

    <h2>Executable Files</h2>
    <p>
    sample32-cuda-xxx or sample64-cuda-xxx are executable files.  The
    executable files needs two arguments: number of block and number
    of outputs.  Invoking without arguments, these executable files
    show suitable block number for GPU device 0, but this block number
    is not reliable.</p>
