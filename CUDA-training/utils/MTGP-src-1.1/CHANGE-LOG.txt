ver. 1.1
-------
Parameter files of mtgp32 are changed for better dimension of
equidistributions.  This change cause changes of outputs, but this not
cause effect on floating point outputs. The changes affect only on
9 LSB bits of unsigned integers and the 9 LSB bits are discarded when
converting to floating points.  You can also use old paramter files
instead of new ones. This change reflects the improvement of MTGPDC
ver. 0.3.

Sample files for cuda now can be compiled in CUDA 4.0 environment.

ver. 1.0.2
-------
change cuda-sample MEXP form 23209 and 44497 to 11213.
This is because CUDA occupancy of the latter is larger
than those of the formers.

ver. 1.0.1
-------
fixed 64bit init_by_array, init_by_str bug.

ver. 1.0
-------
The release version.
add using texture sample files.
add tools directory.

ver. 0.2
-------
add mtgp32 files
add period certification to initialization.

ver. 0.1
-------
